Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning are useful for ﬁnding solutions to problems for which there is no clear solution and the situations vary with time, i.e. for probabilistic situations. In this project, we have implemented an AI for the Flappy Bird which makes the computer play the game much more eﬃcient as compared to what a normal human being can do. We have achieved these goals using Genetic Algorithms with an underlying Neural Network Architecture.

For more details regarding the implementation please read the pdf attached with this repository. Any new suggestions are highly welcome.
For using the agent, run Control.py
